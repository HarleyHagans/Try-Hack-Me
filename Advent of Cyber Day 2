Learning Objectives 
    1:Understanding the underlying technology of web servers and how the web communicates.
       ---HTTP---
        HTTP protocol is a client-server protocol to provide communication between a client(Your Computer) and a webserver.
        HTTP request are similar to TCP network request but a HTTP specific request adds a header to indicate the protocol and other information. 
        In every HTTP request there is a method and a target header. 
          The target header will specify what to retrieve from the server. 
            The method header will specify how. 
          When retrieving information from a web server, it is common to use the GET method, such as loading a picture.
          When sending data to a web server, it is common to use the POST method, such as sending login information.
          Ex Request: GET / HTTP/1.1
              Host: tryhackme.com
              User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 Firefox/87.0
              Referer: https://tryhackme.com/
          Once the server receives a request, it will send back a response, including any requested content if successful and a status code. The status code is used to tell the client browser how the webserver interpreted the request. The most common "successful" status code is HTTP 200 OK.
          Ex Response: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
            Server: nginx/1.15.8

            Content-Type: text/html
            Content-Length: 98

            <html>
            <head>
                <title>Advent of Cyber</title>
            </head>
            <body>
                Welcome To Advent of Cyber!
            </body>
            </html>
           This is just one piece. Once you receive content from the web server your browser needs methods to interpret and render the information sent. Web applications are commonly formatted in HTML (HyperText Markup Language), rendered, and styled in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). JavaScript is also commonly used to provide additional functionality.
     
     2:Understand what cookies are and their purpose.      
       ---Cookies---
        HTTP is a stateless protocol. Sent request to a web server cannot be distinguished between users. To solve this problem and identify different users and access levels, the webserver will assign cookies to create and manage a stateful session between the client and server. 
        Cookies are tiny pieces of data (metadata) or information locally stored on your computer that are sent to the server when you make a request.
        Cookies can be assigned any name and any value. Meaning the webserver can store any info it wants. Even malicious info. In this lab we will be focusing on authentication cookies, also known as session cookies. Authentication or session cookies are used to identify you and what access level is attached to your session.
       https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5e73cca6ec4fcf1309f2df86/room-content/64c8a1a54a0e08d9e89701307462f24b.png  is a diagram describing assigning and using a cookie from the initial request to the session request.
       Most of the time the process stats with a POST request to the webserver. The webserver responds verifying it received the data and sets a unique cookie. Cookies are arbitrary and values are determined by best-practice or the web developer. Once the cookie is assigned, as long as the cookie stays locally stored in your browser, all future GET requests will be automatically sent with that cookie to identify you and your access level. The server will locate and deserialize your session upon receipt of the Get request and cookie. Deserialization is the process of taking a data format such as JSON and rebuilding it as an object. If successful, the webserver will reply to your request with a 200 response.
      
      ---Cookie Components---
       Cookies are made up of 11 different components; you can find an explanation of each component in the table below.
Component	Purpose	Example
Name:
  Unique cookie identifier (arbitrarily set by web-server). Always paired with the value component.	
    SessionID
Value:	
  Unique cookie value (arbitrarily set by web-server). Always paired with the name component 
    sty1z3kz11mpqxjv648mqwlx4ginpt6c
Domain:	
  Originating domain of the cookie. Sets the scope of the cookie.
	  .tryhackme.com
Path:	
   Local path to cookie. Sets the scope of the cookie.
	   /
Expires/Max-age:	
   Date/time at which cookies expires
	   2022-11-11T15:39:04.166Z
Size:	
  Disk size of the cookie in bytes. This is typically {Name+Value}
	   91
HttpOnly:	
  Cookie cannot be accessed through client-side scripts
	  (indicated by a checkmark)
Secure:	
  Cookie is only sent over HTTPS
	  (indicated by a checkmark)
SameSite:
  Specifies when a cookie is sent through cross-site requests
	  none
SameParty:
  Extends functionality of SameSite attribute to First-Party sets. 
	  (indicated by a checkmark)
Priority:
  Defines the importance of a cookie. Determines whether it should be removed or held on to
	  High
      
      Cookie components are always prepared in pairs. The main pair is name-value; this will define the name of the cookie and the value of the name. The second pair is the attribute-value pair; this will define an attribute of the cookie and the value of the attribute. Below is an example of what Set-Cookie syntax looks like.
       
       Ex: Set-Cookie: <cookie-name>=<cookie-value>; Domain=<domain-value>; Secure; HttpOnly 
    
    3:Learn how to manipulate and manage cookies for malicious use.   
       ---Cookie Manipulation---
    		Cookie manipulation is modifying a cookie to obtain unintended behavior or information. Cookie manipulation is possible because the cookies are stored locally on your host system. You have complete control over them and may modify them as you please. 
   
   			To modify cookies you need to know how to get to the developer tools. 
   
   			Developer tools can be accessed by pressing F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I. Once developer tools are open, to access your cookies, navigate to the Storage tab in Firefox or Application tab in Chrome/Edge; select the Cookies dropdown on the left-hand side of the console.
				Ctrl+Shift+R does a hard reset fully reconnecting the website and negotiating new cookies. 

				Cookie values may seem random at first; however, they often have an encoded value or meaning behind them that can be decoded to a non-arbitrary value such as a Javascript object.

				From an attacker's perspective, you can decode the cookie value to identify the underlying objects. Once you have identified the underlying objects, you can modify them to what you want. To use the cookie, you will need to encode it back to the original encoding and replace the cookie value. Below is an example of a decoded cookie value.

				{firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"
