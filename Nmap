Nmap 
An in depth look at scanning with Nmap, a powerful network scanning tool. 

When attacking a box it is good to have as much knowledge as possible. 

Steps
 -Gather IPs
 -Find out what services are running
 
 Services are run on ports. Tell Tell ports can give up info such as machines running web servers or active directory domain controllers. 
 These provide more info giving greater insight into whats happening on the target. 
 
 Common ports
 HTTP 80
 HTTPS 443
 NETBIOS 139
 SMB 445
 
 In an Nmap port scan each port will be determined as open, closed, or filtered (usually by a firewall) 
 
 Once open ports are known we can start research for the enumeration phase. 
 
 - Nmap Switches -
 To perform a stealth scan use -sS
 To scan UDP use -sU
 If you wanted to detect a operating system you would use the switch -O
 To determine what version of a service is running use -sV
 To get more information or verbosity utilize -v for even more info use -vv
 Ideally scans will only be ran once. To output the scan in 3 major formats use -oA <basename> 
 To output in a normal format use -oN <file>
 To output into a grepable format use -oG <file>
 If being  loud is not an issue we can enable aggressive mode by using -A
